# ⏰ Don't Miss the Time!
I did my best to provide explanations in the code. Within the GitHub repository, you will find a .md file that I prepared just for you. By reading that file, you can get more detailed information.
The project includes HTML, CSS, and JS. And of course, I didn't forget to add the Dark and Light mode features! 🌙🌞
